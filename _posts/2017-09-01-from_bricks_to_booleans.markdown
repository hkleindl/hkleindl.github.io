When I was a kid, I loved LEGO. I would spend hours digging through each of my giant bins of blocks, searching for the right piece to complete my latest creation. The process of tinkering with different block combinations, rethinking my design, and making changes to the parts that weren't working the way I wanted to was so gratifying. If you know anything about coding, I'm sure you can tell where this is going. 

There are a lot of similarities between building with LEGO and writing code. In programming, you learn new bits of code that do different things based on how they are put together. Just like individual LEGO bricks, the bits of code by themselves are pretty meaningless. However, fit the right bits of code together, and you have a new program. Sometimes I have to dig through my brain or the internet to find the right piece of code that fits perfectly, but when everything comes together, it's such a rewarding experience. Programming is a bit more complex and less tangible than LEGO, but it satisfies the same part my brain. Its almost like being a kid again.
