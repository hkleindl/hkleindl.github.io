When I first started learning Ruby, I was already fairly comfortable with Javascript. Many of the fundamental programming concepts (e.g., loops, conditional statements, data types) had already been introduced to me, so it was just a matter of learning how to implement those concepts using Ruby syntax. 


One of the first things that struck me about Ruby as opposed to Javascript, was the lack of semicolons everywhere. Making sure I didn't forget a semicolon in Javascript was so ingrained into my mind that I kept feeling like I was breaking the law with Ruby. As I got more familiar with Ruby, I began to appreciate its design. Its friendly syntax allowed me to pay less attention to things like semicolons and brackets, and focus more on the functionality of my code.
 
 
Learning Object Oriented Ruby, on the other hand, has been more of a challenge. There were a lot of new, complicated ideas that were difficult for me to grasp. The reader and writer method setups in classes were going completely over my head at first. Something like:

```
class Person
 
  def name=(name)
    @name = name
  end
 
  def name
    @name
  end
end

```
was bewildering to me. Why were there so many occurrences of 'name' and why were there '@' symbols before them? Also, what's all this instance, instantiating, and initialization business? Each of these foreign concepts really took me off guard and it felt like I was sucker punched with all this new complexity. It was intimidating. And a little painful. I kept going though, and through a bit of practice and perseverance, I grew more comfortable with these new concepts. 


One thing I found helpful was to keep in mind what it was like when I was learning Javascript. At first, many of the concepts were difficult to understand since I had no previous coding experience. It was all new and confusing information that eventually became like second nature. Remembering that process made it a little easier to get through the growing pains of learning about OO Ruby.
